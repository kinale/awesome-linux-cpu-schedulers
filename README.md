## CPU Schedulers for Linux
1. [Bore](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler) - BORE (Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer) CPU Scheduler.
2. [Baby](https://github.com/hamadmarri/Baby-CPU-Scheduler) - A very basic and lightweight yet very performant CPU scheduler. Can be used for learning purposes as a base ground CPU scheduler on Linux.
3. [CaCULE](https://github.com/hamadmarri/cacule-cpu-scheduler) - The CacULE CPU scheduler is based on interactivity score mechanism. The interactivity score is inspired by the ULE scheduler (FreeBSD scheduler).
4. [TT](https://github.com/hamadmarri/TT-CPU-Scheduler) - Task Type (TT) is an alternative CPU Scheduler for linux.
5. [MuQSS](http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/muqss) - Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler (MuQSS) is a rewritten implementation of the Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS) concept.
6. [CFS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.html) - CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) is the new desktop process scheduler implemented in Linux 2.6.23 as a replacement for the previous vanilla schedulerâ€™s SCHED_OTHER interactivity code. It is the current linux task scheduler.
7. [BFS](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&q=Brain+Fuck+Scheduler) - BFS (Brain Fuck Scheduler) is a process scheduler designed for the linux kernel as an alternative to the Completely Fair Scheduler.
8. [PDS](https://cchalpha.blogspot.com) - PDS (Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue scheduler) is a linux CPU scheduler whose design principles are to be a simple CPU process scheduler yet efficient and scalable.
9. [BMQ](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-BitMap-Queue-BMQ) - BMQ (BitMap Queue) is a linux CPU scheduler, inspired By Google's Zircon.
10. [Cachy](https://github.com/hamadmarri/cacule-cpu-scheduler) - Cachy is a linux CPU scheduler based on a Highest Response Ration Next (HRRN) policy.
11. [System76 Scheduler](https://github.com/pop-os/system76-scheduler) - Optimizes Linux's CPU scheduler and automatically assigns process priorities for improved desktop responsiveness.
