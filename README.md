## Custom CPU Schedulers for Linux
1. [Bore](https://github.com/firelzrd/bore-scheduler) - BORE (Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer) CPU Scheduler.
2. [Baby](https://github.com/hamadmarri/Baby-CPU-Scheduler) - A very basic and lightweight yet very performant CPU scheduler. Can be used for learning purposes as a base ground CPU scheduler on Linux.
3. [CaCULE](https://github.com/hamadmarri/cacule-cpu-scheduler) - The CacULE CPU scheduler is based on interactivity score mechanism. The interactivity score is inspired by the ULE scheduler (FreeBSD scheduler).
